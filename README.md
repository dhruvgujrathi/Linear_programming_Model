# Linear_programming_Model
This report is regarding the profit and cost model analysis using linear programming formulation and analysis. It is focused on finding the maximised profit and inventory levels that can be stocked at a warehouse that is being rented by a company that we are working with. The company wants to find if the investment in the warehouse is going to get them good profits and how much stock or inventory should they store in the warehouse to get maximum profits. But, they have some constraints that we need to take care of. These factors include the area where the items will be stored, the dimensions of the shelves, the profit amount against every item and sales percentages required to determine the profits.
